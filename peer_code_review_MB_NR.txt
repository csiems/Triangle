* Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

- Commits are very descriptive. My favorite is: "add some sick css styling."

* Is there good spec coverage (unit and integration)?

- Unit and the integration testing is thorough.

* Do all specs pass?

- Yes!

* Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?

- Yes, we used similar logic. It may be better to use more specific logic for the isScaleneTriangle class.

* Are custom classes and methods created?

- Heck Yes!

* Is the site user-friendly?
Yes! It's nice that the user is prevented from entering things like strings and negative numbers that could break your code.
The yellow is also friendly.

* Are there opportunities for refactoring?

- It looks like you're repeating the if else loop in whatTriangleType in your output.vtl file. It would probably work better to do this only in your output file.

* Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

- Looks and works awesome, great job! Nice font!
